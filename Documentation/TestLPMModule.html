<h1>Module <code>TestLPMModule</code></h1>
<p>Low Power Mode test module
 - contains Low Power Mode related test cases</p>

    <dl class="function">
    <dt>
    <a name = "suite_setup"></a>
    <strong>suite_setup ()</strong>
    </dt>
    <dd>
    suite_setup function ensures that terminal is not in the moving state and not in the low power mode
 executed before each test suite
 * actions performed:
 lpmTrigger is set to 0 so that nothing can put terminal into the low power mode
 function checks if terminal is not the low power mode (condition necessary for all GPS related test cases)
 *initial conditions:
 running Terminal Simulator with installed AVL Agent, running Modem Simulator with Gateway Web Service and
 GPS Web Service switched on
 *Expected results:
 lpmTrigger set correctly and terminal is not in the Low Power mode







</dd>
    <dt>
    <a name = "setup"></a>
    <strong>setup ()</strong>
    </dt>
    <dd>
    setup function puts terminal into the stationary state and checks if that state has been correctly obtained
 it also sets gpsReadInterval (in position service) to the value of gpsReadInterval, sets all 4 ports to low state
 and checks if terminal is not in the IgnitionOn state
 executed before each unit test
 *actions performed:
 setting of the gpsReadInterval (in the position service) is made using global gpsReadInterval variable
 function sets stationaryDebounceTime to 1 second, stationarySpeedThld to 5 kmh and simulated gps speed to 0 kmh
 then function waits until the terminal get the non-moving state and checks the state by reading the avlStatesProperty
 set all 4 ports to low state and check if terminal is not in the IgnitionOn state
 *initial conditions:
 terminal not in the low power mode
 *expected results:
 terminal correctly put in the stationary state and IgnitionOn false state

    </dt>
    <dd>
    TC checks if terminal is put into Low Power Mode if the trigger of LPM is set to IgnitionOff and
 the trigger is active for period above the lpmEntryDelay
 *actions performed:
 configure port 1 as a digital input and associate this port with IgnitionOn line
 (funcDigInp1 = 2), set the high state of the port to be a trigger for line activation
 (digStatesDefBitmap = 3); set lpmEntryDelay to one minute and IgnitionOff as the trigger of Low Power Mode;
 simulate port 1 value change to high state and check if terminal entered IgnitionOn state
 then simulate port 1 value change to low state and check if terminal entered IgnitionOff state
 wait for time longer than lpmEntryDelay and check if after this period terminal is in Low Power Mode
 *initial conditions:
 terminal not in the moving state and not in the low power mode, gps read periodically with interval of
 gpsReadInterval; all 4 ports in LOW state, terminal not in the IgnitionOn state
 *expected results:
 terminal correctly put in the Low Power Mode

    TC checks if terminal is not put into Low Power Mode if the trigger of LPM is set to IgnitionOff and
 the trigger is active for period below the lpmEntryDelay time
 *actions performed:
 configure port 1 as a digital input and associate this port with IgnitionOn line
 (funcDigInp1 = 2), set the high state of the port to be a trigger for line activation
 (digStatesDefBitmap = 3); set lpmEntryDelay to one minute and IgnitionOff as the trigger of low power mode;
 simulate port 1 value change to high state and check if terminal entered IgnitionOn state
 then simulate port 1 value change to low state and check if terminal entered IgnitionOff state
 wait for time shorter than lpmEntryDelay and check if  terminal is not put in Low Power Mode
 *initial conditions:
 terminal not in the moving state and not in the low power mode, gps read periodically with interval of
 gpsReadInterval; all 4 ports in LOW state, terminal not in the IgnitionOn state
 *expected results:
 terminal not put in the Low Power Mode

    <strong>test_LPM_whenLpmTriggerSetTo1TerminalInLpmAndIgnitionOnStateBecomesTrueTerminalPutOutOfLowPowerMode ()</strong>
    </dt>
    <dd>
    TC checks if terminal is put out of Low Power Mode if the trigger of LPM is set to IgnitionOff and
 IgnitionOn state becomes true
 *actions performed:
 configure port 1 as a digital input and associate this port with IgnitionOn line (funcDigInp1 = 2)
 set the high state of the port to be a trigger for line activation (digStatesDefBitmap = 3);
 set lpmEntryDelay to one minute and IgnitionOff as the trigger of low power mode;
 simulate port 1 value change to high state and check if terminal entered IgnitionOn state
 then simulate port 1 value change to low state and check if terminal entered IgnitionOff state
 wait for time longer than lpmEntryDelay and check if after this period terminal is not in Low Power Mode
 after that simulate IgnitionOn and check if terminal is put out of the Low Power Mode
 *initial conditions:
 terminal not in the moving state and not in the low power mode, gps read periodically with interval of
 gpsReadInterval; all 4 ports in LOW state, terminal not in the IgnitionOn state
 *expected results:
 terminal correctly put out of the Low Power Mode
