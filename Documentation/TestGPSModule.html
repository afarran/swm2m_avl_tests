    <dd>
    suite_setup function ensures that terminal is not in the moving state and not in the low power mode
 executed before each test suite
 * actions performed:
 lpmTrigger is set to 0 so that nothing can put terminal into the low power mode
 function checks if terminal is not the low power mode (condition necessary for all GPS related test cases)
 *initial conditions:
 running Terminal Simulator with installed AVL Agent, running Modem Simulator with Gateway Web Service and
 GPS Web Service switched on
 *Expected results:
 lpmTrigger set correctly and terminal is not in the Low Power mode

    <strong>setup ()</strong>
    </dt>
    <dd>
    the setup function puts terminal into the stationary state and checks if that state has been correctly obtained
 it also sets gpsReadInterval (in position service) to the value of gpsReadInterval
 executed before each unit test
 *actions performed:
 setting of the gpsReadInterval (in the position service) is made using global gpsReadInterval variable
 function sets stationaryDebounceTime to 1 second, stationarySpeedThld to 5 kmh and simulated gps speed to 0 kmh
 then function waits until the terminal get the non-moving state and checks the state by reading the avlStatesProperty
